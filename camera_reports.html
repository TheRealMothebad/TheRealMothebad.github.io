    <p>"Mountain Range" | 1/80 f/4.5 29.0mm 100 ISO | SDC hill</p>
    <img src="photos/camera_report/IMG_3244.jpg" alt="pending alt text"
    title="I like this photo, but I want to go back and try again with some smaller apertures">

    <p>"A Pleasant Stroll" | 1/80 f/4.5 29.0mm 200 ISO | Graveyard across from the SDC</p>
    <img src="photos/camera_report/IMG_3247.jpg" alt="pending alt text"
    title="This was snapped spur of the moment when I saw these two walking in the grave yard. I spent a lot of time editing out the hastyness of the original shot.">
    <hr>
    <p>"Yellow Flowers" | 1/80 f/4.5 18.0mm 400 ISO | Lot 23</p>
    <img src="photos/camera_report/IMG_3249.jpg" alt="pending alt text"
    title="This is another photo that could benefit from a revisit with a higher aperture.">
    <hr>
    <p>"Defiance of Gradient" | 1/250 f/25.0 48.0mm 800 ISO | Lot 23</p>
    <img src="photos/camera_report/IMG_3255.jpg" alt="pending alt text"
    title="I love the color on this one so much I didn't mess with it at all. I think this picture represents my struggle with rule of thirds. I tried a lot of different crops, and ended up here.">
    <hr>
    <p>"Wow!" | 10" f/18.0 41.0mm 100 ISO | Breakers Beach</p>
    <img src="photos/camera_report/IMG_3286.jpg" alt="pending alt text"
    title="Now this is my favorite gradient. It's wild to me that this is a natual photo.">
    <hr>
    <p>"Lit" | 1/800 f/5.6 300.0mm 6400 ISO | Breakers Beach</p>
    <img src="photos/camera_report/IMG_3258.jpg" alt="pending alt text"
    title="This was from my first session trying to capture fire. Also a good reminder on why to avoid 6400 ISO. Raw noise reduction is powerful, but not this powerful">
    <hr>
    <p>"Enjoying the Lights" | 3.2" f/3.5 18.0mm 6400 ISO | Breakers Beach</p>
    <img src="photos/camera_report/IMG_3258.jpg" alt="pending alt text"
    title="I attempted to capture the lights, still need some practice though. I think my aperture was too low, and my exposure was too short.">
