    <p>"Grain"</p>
    <img src="photos/aotm/plate.JPG" alt="A floor electrical panel on vibrant wood grain."
    title="My camera (Canon Eos T3i) does very interesting things in low light. This is one of them.">

    title="The clouds just don't fail me (well they do but you don't see those ones). I usualy turn up the contrast, and darken the image. That allows the differences in shading to be more pronounced as they now span the entirety of the grey spectrum.">
