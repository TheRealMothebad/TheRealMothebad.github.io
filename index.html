<p class="gray"><font size="5">Guillaume Amontons was a french physicist who is probably best known for his research into friction, which produced Amontons three laws of friction.</font></p>
<p class="gray"><font size="5">Five Facts: 
  <p class="gray"><font size="5"> - Was born on August 31st, 1663, in Paris France. He became deaf in third grade.
   <p class="gray"><font size="5"> - Developed Amontons three laws of friction.
     <p class="gray"><font size="5">  -Designed the first sterling engine, "Amonton's fire mill"
       <p class="gray"><font size="5">- Was recomended for the position “Membre Premier titulaire” of the reformed acadamy by a friend, and was aproved.
         <p class="gray"><font size="5">- Sadly, Amontons died a few days later, on october 11th, 1705 from peritonitis. and never got to hear the news of his appointment.<br><br><br><br>

          <p class="gray"><font size="6">Amontons Three laws of friction:<br>
            <p class="gray"><font size="5">1. The force of friction is directly proportional to the applied load.<br>2. The force of friction is independent of the apparent area of contact.<br>3. Kinetic friction is independent of the sliding velocity.
