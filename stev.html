    <p>Dear Steve!</p>
    <p>I really like photography. It is now a habit of mine to take a dedicated camera to any new place I go (and some old) to see if I can capture something interesting. During my time in this class, I feel like I have actually gotten worse at photography in a good way. When I first started with the Canon I only took sylized photos of inanimate objects. They turned out pretty good, but always seemed like more of a crutch than a sign of skill. After seeing some of the collections in the artist responses, I was modivated to try to expand my subject matter. Partly because I am still shooting in complete manual (no autofocus), these photos have been more challenging to make Just Right.It is obviously worth it though. Mastery from experience and experience from failure and all that.</p>
    <p>In terms of techniques, I feel a lot more confident in knowing what effect a given slider will produce. This class has pushed me to intermitently explore more dramatic settings, which has been nice. I really want to expand in that area going forward though, as I feel like I usually spend a lot of time making imperceptible changes.
